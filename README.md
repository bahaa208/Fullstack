# Fullstack

introduction: 
  
As part of the project, we wanted to create a system for managing tests for lecturers and students, which would allow the creation of closed or open tests by the lecturers.
  
• In addition, we wanted to allow students to answer the tests and receive a grade manually by the teacher.
We implemented the project as a website using the following technologies:

• Client side: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, Bootstrap
  
•Server side: ASP.NET API + EF
• Database: SQL
